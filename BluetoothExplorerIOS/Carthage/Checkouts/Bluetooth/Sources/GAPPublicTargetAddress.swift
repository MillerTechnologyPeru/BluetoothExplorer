/// The Public Target Address data type defines the address of one or more intended recipients of an advertisement when one or more devices were bonded using a public address.
/// This data type is intended to be used to avoid a situation where a bonded device unnecessarily responds to an advertisement intended for another bonded device.
///
/// Size: Multiples of 6 octets
/// The format of each 6 octet address is the same as the Public Device Address defined in Vol. 6, Part B, Section 1.3.
///
/// The public device address is divided into the following two fields:
/// company_assigned field is contained in the 24 least significant bits
/// company_id field is contained in the 24 most significant bits
